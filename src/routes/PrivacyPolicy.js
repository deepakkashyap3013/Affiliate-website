        <p>
          As a fellow Internet user myself, I totally respect
          https://myparentingcare.netlify.app/ online privacy. So it goes
          without saying that I’m fully committed to safeguarding
          https://myparentingcare.netlify.app/ online privacy while
          https://myparentingcare.netlify.app/’re here at the Mysterious
          Writings website. And that’s precisely why I’ve decided to include the
          following, which discloses the information gathering and dissemination
          practices for this website.
        </p>
        <h3>Log Files</h3>
        <p>
          Like most standard websites, this website uses log files. These
          include: Internet Protocol addresses (IP addresses), browser type,
          Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type,
          date/time stamp, and the number of clicks to analyze trends,
          administer the site, track user movement in the aggregate, and to
          gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses,
          etc., are not linked to personally identifiable information.
        </p>
        <h3>Web Cookies and Beacons</h3>
        <p>
          Web cookies (also known as HTTP cookies, or just cookies) are parcels
          of text that are sent by a server to a Web browser, and then sent back
          unchanged by the browser each time it accesses that server. In other
          words, a cookie is a piece of data stored on a user’s computer that is
          tied to information about the user. Web beacons are objects that are
          embedded in a webpage or email that are invisible to the user, but
          allow checking that a user has viewed the page or email. Other names
          are web bug, tracking bug, tag or page tag.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website does "not" use cookies. Additionally, some of my business
          partners (for example, advertisers) may use cookies and web beacons as
          well. This site has no access to, or control of advertisers’ web
          cookies or web beacons. If https://myparentingcare.netlify.app/ wish
          to enable cookies, https://myparentingcare.netlify.app/ may do so
          through https://myparentingcare.netlify.app/ individual browser
          options.
        </p>
        <h3>Links</h3>
        <p>
          This website contains links to other websites. Please be aware that I
          am not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. I
          encourage https://myparentingcare.netlify.app/, when
          https://myparentingcare.netlify.app/ leave this website, to read the
          privacy policy (or privacy statement) of each and every website
          https://myparentingcare.netlify.app/ visit, as this particular privacy
          policy applies solely to this particular website.
        </p>
        <h3>Advertisers</h3>
        <p>
          https://myparentingcare.netlify.app/ uses outside advertising networks
          and companies in order to display ads on this site. These ads may
          contain cookies and/or web beacons in order to collect data in the ad
          serving process. These such cookies and/or web beacons are collected
          by the companies and/or advertising networks, themselves. I do not
          have any access to this information.
          https://myparentingcare.netlify.app/ currently works with several
          advertising networks and companies, such as: google adsense. If you
          have any questions, please check their websites for their respective
          privacy policies.
